<h1>Tell It Today</h1><br>
<h3> 1. Dear is the story of wonderful love<br>
Told of a saviour. Who came from above,<br>
Bore all our sins, and in sorrow and shame,<br>
Suffered and died a lost world to reclaim.<br><br>

Chorus<br>
Tell it today, it will brighten the way,<br>
Tell it today, tell it today;<br>
No other theme can such blessing bestow;<br>
Joy will come to someone if you tell it today.<br><br>

2. Torn were His feet by the briars of scorn;<br>
Pierced was His forehead by many a thorn;<br>
Wounded for us were His hands and His side,<br>
Broken the heart of the Lord crucified.<br><br>

3. When, with the loved ones whoâ€™ve gone on before,<br>
Ransomed we stand on than beautiful shore;<br>
When in His beauty our savior we see,<br>
Oh what a glorious day that will be!<br>
