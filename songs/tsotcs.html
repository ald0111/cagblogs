<h1>The Song Of The Christian Sailors</h1><br>
<h3> 1.Come, join the Christian sailors, folks<br>
Hurry! your orders get<br>
We are not heading for any earthly port<br>
Let's sail beyond the sunset<br>
Let's sail beyond the sunset<br>
Blow high, blow low<br>
We are raring to go<br>
With His word as our Light<br>
Trusting in His Might<br>
We, Christian sailors, will go<br><br>

2.Knifing it sharply through the waves<br>
Our mighty vessel speeds<br>
We work hard and none misbehaves<br>
Each on the Master's voice heeds<br>
Steadfast! Steadfast! steadfast!<br>
The word goes round and round<br>
With a steadfast aim<br>
No thought of personal fane<br>
Christian sailors, we, move on.<br><br>

3.Christian sailors, Christian sailors<br>
We'll never drop the anchor midway<br>
Nor beach the vessel, come what may<br>
Cast away all your fears<br>
Sickness and sorrows, folks, may roll over us<br>
But sure they canâ€™t drown us<br>
By His pure Grace, we'll outride the worst of storms<br><br>

4.Christain sailors, tune your ears to hear the Heav'nly band<br>
That's our signal to land<br>
Anchor at Glory Land<br>
Anchor at Glory Land<br>
The unchanging flag with the cross as its insignia<br>
E'er the same, no matter the area<br>
Truly blessed to be of this crew<br>
Rough seas don't unsettle us Christ Commands the sea<br>
And the fierce raging tempest<br>
Let's rejoice and shout for Joy!<br>
Yo ho ho ho Yo ho ho ho<br>
Yo ho<br>
Ha ha haha haha haha<br>
Praise God!<br>
