<h1>God Is So Big</h1><br>
<h3> My God is so bid and so strong And so mighty<br>
There's nothing my God cannot do<br><br>

1. In the beginning God made everything<br>
God simply spoke and the world came to be<br>
He sent a flood and made everything new<br>
He parted the sae and let His people walk through<br>
He helped a boy bring a giant right down<br>
Joshua marched, the walls fell to the ground<br>
These acts of power are worthy of prise<br>
But if you want to question my God and His ways<br>
I'll look in the eye and say<br><br>

2. Through we sinners He still gave us worth<br>
God sent His Son to live here on earth<br>
He healed the sick, He made blind men see<br>
He let the lame walk and He set the world free<br>
He died on the cross and He rose from the grave<br>
He conquered sin He is mighty to save<br>
He went to Heaven and He's coming back<br>
God's word is true if it's attacked<br>
I'll look you in the eye and say<br><br>

3. God, the sprit, God the Father, God, the Son<br>
One plus One plus One equals one<br>
I want the world to know about my God<br>
I want to live the whole world can see<br>
That my heart has changed I'm forgiven and new<br>
If people need proof may they see it in me<br>
Let's look the world in the eye<br>
Let's look you in the eye and say
</h3>
