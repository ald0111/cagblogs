<h1>From The Distant</h1><br>
<h3>1. From the distant east and the farthest west<br>
I will bring my people home<br>
Let my people return from the distant land<br>
I will bring my people home<br><br>

Chorus<br>
	Some one is shouting in the desert<br>
	Prepare a road for the lord<br>
	Make a path straight for him to travell<br>
	Prepare a road for lord<br>
	Turn away from your sins<br><br>

2. Do not cling to the past or the long ago<br>
I will bring my people home<br>
I will make a road and the rivers flow<br>
I will bring my people home<br><br>

3.Do not be afraid as you pass through fire<br>
I will bring my people home<br>
Do not be afraid as you pass through fire<br>
I will bring my people home.<br>
