<h1>Jesus My lord</h1><br>
<h3> 1. Jesus my Lord, I cling to you;<br>
The path is hard, Please pull me through<br><br>

Fill my heart with Your Love<br>
Let it overflow<br>
Let me fell Your presence<br>
And in spirit grow<br><br>

I feel lost and helpless<br>
Be with me in everything you I do<br>
Let me not go astray<br>
Whatever the world puts on display<br><br>

You guide me Lord, And lead the way<br><br>

2. You hold my hand, Lord, lest I stray<br>
Let me not be shaken<br>
In my faith or heart<br>
I won’t be forsaken<br>
You will never part<br><br>

Sanctity’s my sole need<br>
Purify my thought and word and deed<br>
Lord, ever be with me<br>
No matter how worth – less I may be<br><br>

You guide me Lord And lead the way<br>
You hold my hand Lord, lest I stray<br><br>

3.Jesus, my Lord I cling to you<br>
The path is hard Please pull me through<br><br>

Fill my heart with Your Love<br>
Let it overflow<br>
Let me feel Your presence<br>
And in sprit grow<br><br>

Fill me with Your spirit<br>
And to fight the good fight, keep me fit<br>
Let my only goal be<br>
To live with You, Lord eternally<br><br>

Jesus, my Lord, I cling to you;<br>
The path is hard, Please pull me through.<br>
